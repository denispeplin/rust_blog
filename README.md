# The project

This is a Markdown-based blogging engine written in Rust

## Description

I'm starting this project with near to zero knowledge of Rust language,
and the things I want to do here are pretty complex for a newbie.

To accomplish my goals, I'm using ChatGPT to create most of the code in this project for now.

In addition to ChatGPT code I have to do some debugging myself, since ChatGPT can't fix everything it writes.

This might be changed in the future.

## How to run it

Run it using

```bash
cargo run
```

You might need to use nightly Rust builds for this particular project

```bash
rustup override set nightly
```
